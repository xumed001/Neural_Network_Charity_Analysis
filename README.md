# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview
This repo uses Machine learning and Neural Networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The csv dataset contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from the Alphabet Soup over a period of time. 

The data is preprocessed using pandas and OneHotEncoder. After the preprocessing is complete StandardScaler is applied and the data is feed to the tensorflow model.
